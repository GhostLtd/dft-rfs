        title: View format description
        copy: |
          ## Format description

          The data pasted must comprise groups of cells containing:

          1. Country name or category name (see below)
          2. 2-letter country code, in brackets (optional)
          3. Vehicle count

          ## Valid category names

          * Other countries
          * Unknown countries
          * Unaccompanied trailers
          * Total vehicles
          * Total powered vehicles

          ## Error checking

          There are two potential types of error, which may be shown when you submit your data:
          
          1. **Unused rows:** row data that looks like a "Country, Count" grouping, but isn't (e.g. "Irelond 83")

          2. **Totals mismatch:** If you include either "Total vehicles" or "Total powered vehicles", and error will be 
          shown if actual totals don't match the totals from your data. This serves as a good extra check that the 
          system has recognised all of your country names.
          
          These errors must be fixed before you will be able to continue.

          ## Example data

          ```
           United Kingdom          (GB)     23
           France                  (FR)     10
           Ireland                         383
           Other countries                  27
           Unaccompanied trailers           10
           Total vehicles                  453
           Total powered vehicles          443
