These surveys are used to record the working activities of heavy goods vehicles and build up a picture of freight being
carried in and around the UK and abroad. The data collected will be anonymised and the findings will not identify you or
your business and will be used to inform government policy and decision making. The data collected is also of use to
public services and research more widely and anonymised extracts are, under strictly managed arrangements, provided to
local and national government, consultants and academics for research purposes.

At all times, we will treat the information you provide in the strictest confidence and in line with current data
protection legislation.

The data will be used in producing anonymised statistics which can be viewed at:

Your personal and commercial details will only be known to the teams at the Department for Transport who process the
completed forms. Your data will be stored securely and retained until the Department for Transport no longer requires
it for the production or quality assurance of the statistics that they were collected for. Your personal details will
only be used to contact you regarding information entered onto the survey and will not be shared with any third parties.

Information on how to contact the Data Protection Officer, exercise your rights in relation to your personal data, and
on how to complain, can be found at:
